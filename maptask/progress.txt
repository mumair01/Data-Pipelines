- Started implementing the pipeline
- Added ability to download the maptask corpus including the audio.
- Added ability to separate the left and right tracks of the downloaded audio.
- Added ability to use opensmile binaries to extract genome features


DATE: 5/10/22
- Audio download shell script moved to a shell scripts folder to separate scripts.
- Tested method to extract gemap features as expected in the original code.
    - Now uses downloaded opensmile binary from: https://github.com/audeering/opensmile/releases
    - Binary used to extract audio features using opensmile config files by Skantze.

DATE: 5/11/22
- Implementing the get vocabulary method based on the existing implementation.
- There can be another class called MapTaskProcessor that is specific to
    a specific MapTask pipeline.
- There can be a general pipeline class that can manage the Threads etc.
- Notes for when refactoring:
    - Potential classes:
        1. MapTask class --> Responsible for downloading and parsing the corpus.
    - Features to add when refactoring:
        1. Method for obtaining the files in different directories.
        2. Method for obtaining all files and / or sub-dirs in a dir.
        3. General methods for parsing the downloaded data.
        4. Method for collecting files based on common filenames.
        5. Method to extract features given an audio file.
        6. Methods to write to different file formats i.e., hd5, pickle, json etc.
        7. Methods for parsing specific xml files in the original MapTask data.
