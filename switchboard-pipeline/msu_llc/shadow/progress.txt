- Overhauling the merge script to improve readability and add additional
    metrics for comparison of multiple sources of transcription.
-- Working on the merge_da_timing_data to merge files from the MSU / LLC
    transcriptions.
-- The merge method works mostly - still need to check the exact matchings.
-- However, I'm not sure how the original data is being extracted based on
    quality, because it does take away from the context of the conversation.
    The output might only be independent TCU examples, and may not be used
    in a contextual way.
